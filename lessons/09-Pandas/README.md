## DRF Errata

- I forgot to install `rest_framework` in our `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`
- Also, Zak's example uses the `fields = '__all__'` which simplifies the `Serializer`

## Database Review

- What is `csvkit`?
- What is `agate`?
- What do you like about them?
- What do you not like or wish they could do?

## Pandas

Pandas is a data table wrangling and visualization library. It's a lot like `csvkit` and `agate`, only more powerful. It has a lot of import export features for formats like CSV, JSON, XML, HTML, and even SQL so it's useful as a translator between data formats. And it can produce beautiful plots.
